(Verse)
I love her, can&rsquo;t leave her,
Forever I&rsquo;ll always need her,
She lie, but I believe her,
Lovesick I got that fever.
Love stupid, I know it,
Love stupid, I know it,
I know, cause I&rsquo;m a fool in love.

My baby shot me down again,
Shot me down with the love and it go bang bang.
That girl&rsquo;s a killer from a gang,
Shot me down with the love and it go bang bang.

And oh, I love her so, that&rsquo;s why I gotta let her know
That I&rsquo;ll be here for her to always love her down.

And maybe that&rsquo;s the truth,
The clock can tick and ain&rsquo;t no use,
I wonder when my tux can see you when you&rsquo;re down.

(Chorus)
Bang, bang,
Got him with a bang,
Love him down, down
I shot my baby with a bang, bang,
Got him with a bang,
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
Bang, bang,
Got him with a bang,
Love him down, down
I shot my baby with a bang, bang,
Got him with a bang,
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

(Verse)
I love her, can&rsquo;t leave her,
Forever I&rsquo;ll always need her,
She lie, but I believe her,
Lovesick I got that fever.
Love stupid, I know it,
Love stupid, I know it,
I know, cause I&rsquo;m a fool in love.

My baby shot me down, down, down, down
Shot me down with the love and it went pow-pow
I love my baby&rsquo;s freaky style,
But my baby&rsquo;s always sneaking out.

But damn, I love her so,
That&rsquo;s why I gotta let her know
That I&rsquo;ll be here for her, I&rsquo;ll always be her man.
And baby, that&rsquo;s the truth,
You&rsquo;re my chick, bottlecruise,
I got that roof, I put that diamond on her hand.

(Chorus)
Bang, bang,
Got him with a bang,
Love him down, down
I shot my baby with a bang, bang,
Got him with a bang,
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
Bang, bang,
Got him with a bang,
Love him down, down
I shot my baby with a bang, bang,
Got him with a bang,
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

(Bridge)
Oh, yeah, I love my baby
Hey baby yeah I love you,
Stupid is what stupid do,
Tom and Jerry and Scooby Do,
Oh baby, I&rsquo;m a fool for you.
Come here, baby, be my lollypop,
I make it better, make the booty drop.
Hey baby, can&rsquo;t get you out my brains,
Damn girl, you&rsquo;re such a sexy thing.
Pretty little lady
And my baby makes me go down down
My baby makes me go down down
My baby makes me go down down
My baby makes me go down down&hellip;
I was 5 and he was 6
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight
Chorus 
Bang bang, you shot me down.
Bang bang, i hit the ground.
Bang bang,that awful sound.
Bang bang, my baby shot me....... down

Seasons came and changed the time
And i grew up, i called him mine 
You would always laugh and say
"rememeber when we used to play".

Bang bang,i shot you down
Bang bang,you hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, i used to shoot you down

Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang
Hey...hey...hey...hey

Now you gone i don't know why
Till this day, sometimes i cry
You didn't even say goodbye 
You didn't take the time to lie

(chorus:bang bang.........)
Relax and take notes, while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke - gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer
The hooker layer - motherfucker say your prayers
Hail Mary full of grace... smack the bitch in the face; 
Take her Gucci bag and the North Face
Off her back, jab her if she act
Funny with the money oh you got me mistaken honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
The Visa, kapeesha? I'm out like, "The Vapors"
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho, the head honcho
Swift fist like Camacho, I got so
Much style I should be down wit the Stylistics
Make up to break up {*singing in background*} niggaz need to wake up
Smell the indonesia; beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins til amnesia
She don't remember shit! Just the two hits! 
Her hittin the floor, and me hittin the clits! 
Suckin on the tits! Had the hooker beggin for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly love; my dick got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was "Humpin Around" and "Jump-in Around"
Jacked her then I asked her who's the man; she said, "B-I-G"
Then I bust in her E-Y-E (Yo Big, you're dead wrong)
 
Chorus 2X
 
When I get dusted, I like to spread the blood like mustard
Trust it, my hardcore rain leaves you rusted
Move over Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, huh
Leave your toothless, you'll kibbitz, I'll flip it
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the tech G
Disrespect me - my potency is deadly
I'm shootin babies, no ifs ands or maybes
Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis
After she sucked the dick, I stabbed her brother with the icepick
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
But Smalls don't get down like that... (no question)
Got your father hidin in a room; fucked him with the broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealin with?
Anybody step into my path is fuckin feelin it! 
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab ya til you're gushy, so please don't push... me
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen
The black demon, got the little hookers screamin
Baby I've tried for you
But this heart's not bullet proof
It's like you live with all your guns against me
You shoot love down you push my heart around
And I'm taking no more
Of your faking no more
 
Bang bang You shot my heart
Bang bang Blown it apart
Bang bang You blew my love away hey hey hey
Bang bang You fire on me
Your hurt and jealousy
Bang bang You've blown our love away hey hey hey
 
You shoot love down you push my heart around
But I'm taking no more
Of your faking no more
 
Bang bang...
Bang bang...
I should've known
When we met at the late show
You and me, dangerous
Sittin' way too close
2am, at my door
Where you dropped me off
Tell me how in the hell
Did I end up with my hand on the barrell
 
It's time that you paid
I want you to clean up the mess that you made
 
Like a bitch out of order
Like a bat out of hell
Like a fish out of water
I'm scared, can't you tell
 
Bang Bang
Put my gun down on the table
Before you try to blow my mind
I used to think it was you
Who was so unstable
But now I'm sure I'm close behind
 
B-B-Bang
B-B-Bang Bang Boom
 
I thought you were good
You painted me bad
Compared to the others
The best thing I had
But then I discovered
It couldn't get worse
You're buildin' my coffin
You're drivin' the hearse
I thought it was you
I loved you the most
But I was just keepin'
My enemies close
I made a decision to never look back
So how did you end up with all of my jack
 
Woh-oh-oh
Bang Bang
 
I should've known
You were too good to be true
You were hidin' both your horns
And I was such a fool
It's not a race
Wasn't trying to beat you
Trip me up, shut me down
When I was with you
 
Like a bitch out of order
Like a bat out of hell
Like a fish out of water
I'm scared, can't you tell
 
Bang Bang
Put my gun down on the table
Before you try to blow my mind
I used to think it was you
Who was so unstable
But now I'm sure I'm close behind
 
B-B-Bang
B-B-Bang Bang Boom
 
I thought you were good
You painted me bad
Compared to the others
The best thing I had
But then I discovered
It couldn't get worse
You're buildin' my coffin
You're drivin' the hearse
I thought it was you
I loved you the most
But I was just keepin'
My enemies close
I made a decision I had to employ
So how did you end up with all of my toys
 
I'm not your brother, not your lover
And I'm not your friend
Now that it's over you're another
Kind of different
A new person
Your time is up
And that's my blood in your dixie cup

Sometimes I cry
You didn't say good bye
You didn't take the time to lie

Bang bang you shot me down
Bang bang I hit the ground
Bang bang that awful sound
Bang bang my baby shot me down
Percussion-dominated song, afrobeat loops from Frank Beard.  Composed
For the movie Striptease, though they chose to use "La Grange" instead.

Everybody knows what it's all about
Pretty thing jumpin' all around
Shakin' your money-maker now
Take it off and take me down

Bang, bang, shang-a-lang
Bang, bang, shang-a-lang
Take it off
She bang-bang my shang-a-lang
She bang-bang my shang-a-lang
Hey yeah

Tear me up, baby, tear me down
You got me movin' upside down
Feelin' good, I'm feelin' alright
Do it again, do it all night

Bang, bang, shang-a-lang
Bang, bang, shang-a-lang
Take it off, take it off
She bang-bang my shang-a-lang
She bang-bang my shang-a-lang
(popgun!)

Hey, hey, hey...

Do me once, baby do me twice
Do it 'cos it feels so nice
I don't care 'bout nothin' else
Do me 'til my money melts

Bang, bang, shang-a-lang, take it off
Bang, bang, shang-a-lang, hey yeah
She bang-bang my shang-a-lang
She bang-bang my shang-a-lang
Hey

She was five and I was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
I wore black and she wore white
She would always win the fight
 
Bang, bang, she shot me down
Bang, bang, I hit the ground
Bang, bang, that awful sound
Bang, bang, my baby shot me down
 
Seasons came and changed the time
I grew up, I called her mine
She would always laugh and say
Remember when we used to play
 
Bang, bang, I shot you down
Bang, bang, you hit the ground
Bang, bang, that awful sound
Bang, bang, I used to shoot you down
 
The music played and people sang
And just for me the church bells rang
 
Hey, bang, bang, bang, bang
Hey, bang, bang, bang, bang
Hey, bang, bang, bang, bang
Yeah, bang, bang, bang, bang
 
Now she's gone, I don't know why
Till this day sometimes I cry
She didn't even say goodbye
She didn't take the time to lie
 
Bang, bang, she shot me down
Bang, bang, I hit the ground
Bang, bang, that awful sound
Bang, bang, my baby shot me down
She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang, she shot me
She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang, she shot me
She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang, she shot me
She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang
  (Get out the way, yo)
 
There she goes again, the girl is Ethiopian
In other words, she came through explodin'
In the podium, dynamite
Napoleon like sodium mixed with petroleum
Slowly but surely, she was walking toward me
 
Cut the convo short 'cause she had to wake up early
But continuing the story
Don't worry she gave me digits for her Blackberry
"You're very handsome" is what she said
And the way she looked in my eyes said, "Put me to bed"
 
Oh my, oh my, I should have known
When she said to me on the phone
You do not know me very well but I would never hurt a fly
Then she aimed at my chest with love in her eye
I said, she aimed for my chest with love in her eye
 
She was walkin' around with a loaded shotgun
Ready to fire me a hot one, it went bang, bang, bang
Straight through my heart
Although I could have walked away
I stood my ground and let her spray
 
She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang, she shot me
She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang, she shot me
She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang, she shot me
She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang
 
Scorpion, she's so hot, she's a scorchin'
Killing me softly, Lauryn or Kevorkian
Couldn't tell if she's coo-coo or corky, when
I asked her her name and she said, "Call me Ten"
 
Testing, testing, things just got more interesting
She's dressed in a vest pin, double-breasted holster
A very western toaster, she ain't nothing Kosher
She lets me closer, hotter than a pepper crusted samosa
While I try to keep my composure
 
She was walkin' around with a loaded shotgun
Ready to fire me a hot one, it went bang, bang, bang
Straight through my heart
Although I could have walked away
I stood my ground and let her spray
 
She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang, she shot me
She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang, she shot me
She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang, she shot me
She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang
 
Am I wrong? But what is love without the pain to go along?
And what is pain, if not the reason for me to sing this song?
And this song is for the weak and for the strong
'Cause I was strong and still
 
She got me, she got me, bang, bang, she got me
She got me, she got me, bang, bang
 
She was walkin' around with a loaded shotgun
Ready to fire me a hot one, it went bang, bang, bang
Straight through my heart
Although I could have walked away
I stood my ground and let her spray
 
She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang, she shot me
She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang, she shot me
She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang, she shot me
She shot me, she shot me, bang, bang
Bang! Bang!

It was a warm night on the south side of town
They said they&rsquo;d seen ya
You were sneakin&rsquo; around with a stranger,
Girl these rumors are drivin&rsquo; me mad

All my good friends turn their face to the wall
When they see me, what the hell&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on am I so blind
That I can&rsquo;t see when I&rsquo;m being had

I know it&rsquo;s silly but girl I really thought we had a chance
I must&rsquo;ve been crazy!

Chorus:
Bang Bang, what&rsquo;s that sound
I gave you my love and you shot me down
Bang Bang, you&rsquo;re so cool
Playin&rsquo; a game, someday you&rsquo;re gonna lose
Bang! Bang!

Girl you told me you were not like the rest
Then you showed me now you&rsquo;re failing the test
It was easy just an urge in the heat of the nite

I believed you, now that&rsquo;s all in the past
Cause I made some mistakes but I&rsquo;m learnin&rsquo; fast
Never put your heart on the line!
Never put your heart on the line!

I know it&rsquo;s silly but girl I really thought we had a chance
I must&rsquo;ve been crazy!

(Chorus)
Faster than a bullet train, 
She's like bang bang
You won't even feel the pain
She's like bang bang
 
Faster than a bullet train, 
She's like bang bang
You won't even feel the pain, 
She's like bang bang
 
You've read that I was bad news
Before you even met me
You know the dudes I hang with, 
They ain't exactly friendly
99 bottles on the wall until they empty
You were such a plain jane
Now you go bang bang
 
It was only one kiss, one night, 
But I know you'll never let it slide
All I got is one shot to fix this
And you know I'm gonna make it right
 
So put your hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, she's gonna shoot.
So put your hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, she's gonna shoot.
 
She's got her finger on the trigger like bang bang
And they're right there in the middle like bang bang
So put your hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, she's gonna shoot.
 
I had 30 missed calls and dirty mix drinks
When you found me getting in flirting with the girl on the sink
Call me david copperfield, 
Poof, gone before you blink
And you complain the blame game
I think it goes bang bang
 
It was only one kiss, one night, 
But I know you'll never let it slide
All I got is one shot to fix this
And you know I'm gonna make it right
 
So put your hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, she's gonna shoot.
So put your hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, she's gonna shoot.
 
She's got her finger on the trigger like bang bang
And they're right there in the middle like bang bang
So put your hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, she's gonna shoot.
 
Faster than a bullet train, 
She's like bang bang
You won't even feel the pain
She's like bang bang
 
So put your hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, she's gonna shoot.
So put your hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, she's gonna shoot.
 
She's got her finger on the trigger like bang bang
And they're right there in the middle like bang bang
So put your hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, she's gonna shoota
Dodging bullets.
All match up.
It is all a fake.
With 1 touch booooom.

All that matters.
With reality.
Comes to life.
With the ....Bang.....

Bang Bang,Run away it is my turn.
Bang Bang,Knows that Im outta the way.
Bang Bang,Shut the fuck up.
Bang Bang,Facing reality.

Seeing the chorus,Nothing starts to bleed.
All I am,was just a stupid king.
Knowing I am here,Makes you start to bleed.
For no reason,Livin In one touch.

Bang Bang,Run away it is my turn.
Bang Bang,Knows that Im outta the way.

Bang Bang,Knows that Im outta the way.
Bang Bang,Shut the fuck up.
Bang Bang,Facing reality.

Oh,Yeah.
Somewhere south of Winslow the road went right and I went left
Nothin' out my window but desert, dirt, and death
From outta nowhere stood an angel from up in the air
Sometimes that hot horizon plays tricks on you I swear
 
Oh, I picked her up
 
Sure enough that girl was real, sittin' in my truck
Said I know a place called the Broken Wheel where we can try our luck
Five miles north of 66, behind old man Lester's barn
Where the whisky flows and the money goes and the sherriff
Claims that he don't know
 
Oh, here I go again, singin'
 
BANG BANG
That cell door's closin' in
BANG BANG
Here I go again
BANG BANG
Those chains around my legs
BANG BANG
This is where the highway ends
 
4 AM I was outta cash when she whispered in my ear
I got a gun and a plan, pull the truck up to the rear
Yeah it hit me like a tire tool right between the eyes
When the door flew open - she came out screamin'
 
DRIVE FOOL DRIVE!

Grabbin' they weapon, 'bout to be steppin'
My mutha fuckin' Killaz, gangstaz, crookz, criminalz
All of that type of shit muhfucka

Every time Tha Klepto ridez
BANG BANG, BANG BANG, BANG
Every time a mutha fucka dies
BANG BANG, BANG BANG, BANG

For all the mutha fuckin' Killaz that do they thang like
BANG BANG, BANG BANG, BANG (Repeated)
 
So many muthafuckaz wanna test me
But what they don't know, is I gotta secret recipe
A half of cup of ammunition, a table spoon of A-K
I squeeze tha trigga and unload til' it's emptay
I spray, close range, far away, never missin'
Killa ambition, the preminition of percision
My religion, a sacrafice twice a night
Target locked on, any muhfucka in sight
Excuse me, make way for my uzi
I'm just cruising, thinkin' to myself that you'll never lose me
Never braggin', boastin', til' my barrel be smokin'
Hopin' that tha muhfuckaz hearts explodin'
Nice try Mr. Nice Guy, aimin' for ya left eye
Lopez, BANG BANG, BYE BYE
Second think it, before you choose who ya step to
'cause I could get you, before you ever even knew
 
Every time Tha Klepto ridez
BANG BANG, BANG BANG, BANG
Every time a mutha fucka dies
BANG BANG, BANG BANG, BANG
All tha mutha fuckin' hustlaz that slang
BANG BANG, BANG BANG, BANG

I step into a club, I love to see tha blood
I put thirteen slugs into a wanna be thug
Run muhfuckaz, I love a good pursuit
You turn tha corner, I hesitate to shoot
This individual, a nine-millemeter ritual
With tears in his eyes I scream Ima kill ya'll
Now da club is blazin' with my bullets wastin' and chasin'
Blood splatters erasin', like a chainsaw and Jason
'cause what you are facin', is no ordinary marksman
From the shit you been startin', body parts are departin'
I love moving targets just when they think they escape
I break the strands of fate with eight shots in the face
Murda was tha case, but I plead the fifth
As stiff bodies drift down the river, I'm free 'cause I'm the shit
I don't do my thang, bang bang, 'cause I wanna see you die
I just do it 'cause it's funny as fuck
Every time Tha Klepto ridez
BANG BANG, BANG BANG, BANG
Every time a mutha fucka dies
BANG BANG, BANG BANG, BANG
All tha mutha fuckin' hustlaz that slang
BANG BANG, BANG BANG, BANG
For all the mutha fuckin' Killaz that do they thang like
BANG BANG, BANG BANG, BANG (Repeated)
 
Semi-Automatic spazmatic, I've had it
I grab it, then I ratta-tat-tat-tat-tat-it
Choice or habit, when I release a bullet
Trigga I pull it, 'cause I'm sick of the bullshit
One hit, leads to another and I don't quit
The sky gets lit, from each round I spit
From the chamber, I pop, anotha hater
Bitch boy'z face, is now a crater
Blast off, I blow ya mutha fuckin' ass off
Three, Two, One, like I work for NASA
Firin' fasta, body count is rapidly increasing
More deceasing, releasing, hysterical screaming
It's seeming that I'm being watched from the sky
National Guard, pigz, and the FBI
Looks like it's my turn to feel tha pain
BANG BANG, BANG BANG, BANG
 
Every time Tha Klepto ridez
BANG BANG, BANG BANG, BANG
Every time a mutha fucka dies
BANG BANG, BANG BANG, BANG
All tha mutha fuckin' hustlaz that slang
BANG BANG, BANG BANG, BANG
For all the mutha fuckin' Killaz that do they thang like
BANG BANG, BANG BANG, BANG (Repeated)
 
BANG BANG, BANG BANG, BANG
She woke me up with a bang, bang
Looking over cross eyed had a big
Hunch that the world was a big lie
When I got up all the blood to my head
I got so dizzy fell back to my bed
I went over to the way side
Looking for the high tide
What will I find will I find will I find find
All I saw was a man that had a hat
That had a pom-pom he's been there for
Years can someone tell me how long

[Chorus:]
Wake up to tell me
Wake up to show me
What I could not find

You see this woman woke me up
At a quarter to three and I didn't
Know it then but she put a spell on 
Me said I had to go down to where
The cliffs mee the sea and mean an
Old man to present my plea
So I headed way down to the big pier
To await and confront my big fear
I wheeled around behind to my
Blindside to find and old man with a
Lime and a kind eye
Said mister, mister with your beard so long
Won't you be a saint and tell me
Just where I'm going
He pointed to a conch shell and then
To the lime and said this is all
I really need to get by

[Chorus]

Hey mister man
I know you don't know
Who you think I, think I am
But I can safely say, that I
Should've been sleeping the day
Away I said scuse me, if you've got the
Time he shrugged his shoulders
Said get a spine
Coconut hit me on the head
Jonesin' for a fig
I booked last night
I need another fix
Just then I see a twinkle twinkle
In the old man's eye and a wave
Tossed bottle in thrown to the sky

I caught it on the rebound
It landed with a soft sound
I took out the message and put the
Bottle down
Inside was the antidote to the spell
And I read it to the old man 'cause he
Couldn't read so well
Said don't worry about a 
Thing you know your
Path is true just ease your
Mind have a banana
Or two

Goodness, goodness, woe is me
The man nearly flipped to learn
That he was free but just before we
Left and started kicking it
I picked up the bottle and star sixed it

Kick kick shuffle shuffle back to the beach
With a tune on my lips and my quest in reach

If that woman comes to you with
Her song so sweet, say damn
Let the poor sucker sleep
Sally folded on the ride home,
A drunken driver hit the passenger side,
And the ambulance came but the sirens that rang couldn't make it to the battlefield to say their goodbyes so they sang
 
Bang Bang, Bang Bang, goes a beautiful smile,
Band Bang, Bang Bang, there goes an innocent child
And we never do think that tommorow might be.. 
It's not my time it's not my time
 
Jack was loaded with bread,
Let the sin of money go to his head,
With a kiss of the coin, passed his lips down his throat, with a gasping for air Jack fell down and he choked and we sing
 
Bang bang, Bang Bang, goes a father of three
Bang Bang, Bang Bang, there goes a husband of five
And we never do think that tommorow might be, it's not my time it's not my time
Band Bang Bang Bang, In the blink of an eye,
Bang Bang Bang Bang, No one ever thinks it's their time
And I never do think, that's the problem with me, it's not my time it's not my time
 
It's not my time it's not my time,
It's not my time, It's not your time, It's not our time 
 
"It's not my time", go those famous last words, "Still got ten miles" go those famous last words and we never do think that tonight it might be, "it's not my time it's not my time",
 
And we sang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang

Tous vos désirs me dominent
Tous vos rires tous vos enchantements
Chaque geste
Même inutile
Mêle au désir un affolement
Est-ce ainsi d'écorce
Fille
Que l'on va au monde épais
En quelques battements de cils
Que la pluie de ci de l? br&gt; inonde
 
Avez-vous vu le contour
Est-on encore loin du pacifique
Eh louison gueule d'amour
Attends-tu que te défigure le cockpit
Est-ce ainsi d'écorce
Fille
Que l'on va de ci de l? au monde
En quelques battements de cils
Que la pluie de ci de l? br&gt; inonde
 
Bang bang bang
You shot my heart...
 
C'est le monde qui s'arc-boute
Dans quelques instants nous verrons les cieux
De la piste
De l'autoroute
O? l'on jure que l'on est amoureux
Est-ce ainsi d'écorce
Fille
Que l'on va de ci de l? au monde
En quelques battements de cils
Que la pluie de ci de l? br&gt; inonde
 
Mais jetez quelques instants
Votre doux regard
Au fond des tripes
 
Bang bang bang
You shot my heart...
 
Mais qu'auriez-vous fait sans moi, mes petits chats? 
Eh bien... obéi comme des cadavres!
Mais qu'auriez-vous fait sans moi, mes petits chats? 
Eh bien... obéi comme des cadavres... tiens!
I was five and he was six 
We rode on horses made of sticks 
He wore black and I wore white 
He would always win the fight 
 
Bang bang 
He shot me down, bang bang 
I hit the ground, bang bang 
That awful sound, bang bang 
My baby shot me down 
 
Seasons came and changed the time 
When I grew up, I called him mine 
He would always laugh and say 
Remember when we used to play 
 
Bang bang 
I shot you down, bang bang 
You hit the ground, bang bang 
That awful sound, bang bang 
I used to shoot you down
 
Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang
 
Now he's gone I don't know why 
'Till this day some times I cry 
He didn't even say goodbye 
He didn't take the time to lie 
 
Bang bang 
He shot me down, bang bang 
I hit the ground , bang bang 
That awful sound, bang bang 
My baby shot me down
Bang Bang
I Shot You Down, Bang Bang
You Hit The Ground, Bang Bang
That Awefull Sound, Bang Bang
I Used To Shoot You Down

[Young Buck:]
Don't Nobody Wanna Die, But Everybody Wanna Ball
Somebody Gotta Go, When Them Killa's Call
You Know It's In Us All, You Just Gotta Find It And Use It
You Can Get Away With It, If You Don't Abuse It
The Streets Talk, The Beats Mark, Cuz That Heat Comin'
And If They Know That You Did It, You Better Keep Runnin'
I Think I See Sumthin, There Go My Enemy
Only Lord Knows Where This Nigga F'nd To Be
Tennakee, Still The Price Is As Real If You Look It
Might Give It To You For 5, Depend On If I Took It
Nigga Anything Goes, My Shop Never Close
From The Nickels And The Dimes To The Whole Kilo
The Real Niggas Feel Me, The Haters Wanna Kill Me
But I'm Holdin' Down My City, Me And This 9 Milli
While Your Throwin' Bricks, And Hidin' Ya Heads
Homie, I Know Where You Hang
Ain't No Thang To Walk Up And Let That Chopper Go...

[Backround]
Bang Bang
I Shot You Down, Bang Bang
You Hit The Ground, Bang Bang
That Awefull Sound, Bang Bang
I Used To Shoot You Down

[Young Buck:]
Now All The Gangsta's Pray
Lord, Forgive Me
But He Tried To Kill Me
Somebody Out There Gotta Feel Me
Lord, Forgive Me
But He Tried To Kill Me
Somebody Out There Gotta Feel Me

Just Think If I Ain't Empty The Clip, And He Killed Me
Would I Still Be Livin'?, Would My Homeboy's Miss Me?
How Many Niggas Bust They Gun When They Have To?
Don't Need No Ski Mask When It's Time To Get At You
I'm Glad You Done Seen What It Look Like When We Left
Brain Fragments From Shot-Gun Blasts'll Take A Nigga Breathe
It's Death Before Dishonesty, Dope Deals And Robbery
Poppa Wasn't Around, But That Shit Didn't Bother Me
I'd Probably Be In The Penitentary
But I Played The Cards, The Dead Lord Sent To Me
The Whole Truth, I Use This Booth To Speak To My Thug Niggas
Why You Mad At Me? The Government's The Drug Dealers
Before I Let This Police Kid Harass Me
This Rookie Ass Cop Gon' Have To Blast Me
He Asked Me For Identification, I Looked At Him And Laughed
He Made A Move And I Heard A Blast
That's What You Get, Bitch

[Backround]
Bang Bang
I Shot You Down, Bang Bang
You Hit The Ground, Bang Bang
That Awefull Sound, Bang Bang
I Used To Shoot You Down

[Young Buck:]
Now All The Gangsta's Pray
Lord, Forgive Me
But He Tried To Kill Me
Somebody Out There Gotta Feel Me
Lord, Forgive Me
But He Tried To Kill Me
Somebody Out There Gotta Feel Me

It's Goin Down Around Here Nigga
Get Ya Muthafuckin Head Bust
Them Muthafuckin Street Lights Go Out
And Them Real Niggas Come Out
All The Bitch Niggas Go In The House
Just Not A Game, Man
Don't Fuck Around And Lose Your Brain
And Hey, All My Real Niggas Pray

Lord, Forgive Me
But He Tried To Kill Me
Somebody Out There Gotta Feel Me
Lord, Forgive Me
But He Tried To Kill Me
Somebody Out There Gotta Feel Me

Lord, Forgive Me
But He Tried To Kill Me
Somebody Out There Gotta Feel Me
Lord, Forgive Me
But He Tried To Kill Me
Somebody Out There Gotta Feel Me

Well this ain't the right thing to do, so let's go
 
Young girls they know what they're after
Young girls don't kiss me goodbye
Rocktes shooting up into space
Buildings they rise to the skies
 
Bang bang I got mine
Bang bang reach for the sky
 
I keep a good friend on video tape
He'll drive his sports car until it's too late
But we'll have a hot time on the town tonigh
Cause love is my bet and it's the best yet
 
Bang bang I got mine
Bang bang sun don'tshine
Bang bang you all angels
Bang bang now you all ought to be in pictures
 
Oh girl
Oh girl my problems can't follow me
Phone calls I take my machine

Lonely ha ha ha what does it mean
 
Bang bang I got mine
Bang bang and you are next in line
Bang bang reach for the sky
Bang bang sun don'tshine
 
Rise buildings
Rise to the sky
Young girls they know what they're after
I said, young girls don't kiss me goodbye
Al vaivÃ©n de las olas vas meciÃ©ndote
Y tu cuerpo de palmera va
AbrochÃ¡ndome con su zig-zag, ay, ay, ay.
MuÃ©vete que la luna ya va a despertar
Y la noche estÃ¡ esperÃ¡ndote
ContrÃ³late con suavidad, ay, ay, ay.
Vamos ya, soy el palenque, 
Va empezar, vente que vente, 
Ay mamÃ¡, como se siente, 
Vamos a bailar.
Bang-bang candela, yo traigo el ritmo que pega alla vÃ¡, 
Bang-bang que manera, me gusta como mueve tus caderas.
Ven a gozar bang-bang
No pares de bailar
AsÃ­ con mi bang-bang
Mueve que mueve ay que rico estÃ¡.
MÃ¡gica esta noche es casi mÃ­stica
Tu belleza enigmatica
Me acelera un poco el corazÃ³n, ay, ay, ay.
 
Ã&scaron;nica, entre tu y yo hay quimica
Tu sonrisa que simpÃ¡tica
Hace que yo pierda la razÃ³n, ay, ay, ay.
Vamos ya, soy el palenque, 
Va empezar, vente que vente, 
Ay mamÃ¡, como se siente, 
Vamos a bailar.
Bang-bang candela, yo traigo el ritmo que pega alla vÃ¡, 
Bang-bang que manera, me gusta como mueve tus caderas.
Ven a gozar bang-bang
No pares de bailar
AsÃ­ con mi bang-bang
Mueve que mueve ay que rico estÃ¡.
Bang ay chiqui bang ven a gozar hasta que yo te lleve, 
Ay bang ay chiqui bang que bueno estÃ¡, no pares de bailar
Bang ay chiqui bang muÃ©vete mÃ¡s
Moviendo tus caderas
Bang ay chiqui bang que rico estÃ¡
Se siente mi bang bang.

My heart is going BANG BANG
My heart is going BANG BANG

In a dream
a secret in my mind
My love babe
will stand the test of time

Searching for a man
a lover and a friend
I don't know wich way to go
There's so much love
inside my heart
Only one way that I'll know

My heart is going BANG BANG
My heart is going BANG BANG

You drive me mad
your body's so devine
Face to face
I gotta know you're mine

Searching for a man
a lover and a friend
I don't know wich way to go
There's so much love
inside my heart
Only one way that I'll know

My heart is going BANG BANG
My heart is going BANG BANG

Bang is the world
when you feel like exploding
Bang goes the door
when you're feeling so strong
Bang is the groove,
Bang is the touch
Bang is the feeling
when it gets too much

My heart is going BANG BANG
